Things have been pretty wild in the world of AI-generated videos. Since its launch, Pika Labs has been one of the best cinematic AI video generators. On November 28, 2023, Pika Labs announced its major release [Pika 1.0](https://pika.art/blog){:target="_blank"}. Pika Labs has opened up access to its video generator on Discord and the web, allowing users to generate videos from image(s), video(s) and text(s). Here's how to use it:

**1. Go to the url: [https://pika.art/](https://pika.art/){:target="_blank"}**   
You can sign up via Gmail or Discord.   

**2. Add a text prompt**   
Add a text prompt that describes your story that you want the video to represent. You can also attach an image or a video which helps in customizing your video.   

**3. Hit the *Generate* button, and wait for your video to be generated.**   
All the generated videos will be stored in *my library* section.   

**4. You can further choose Retry, Reprompt, Edit, Add 4s or Upscale.**   
Retry: generate another video by using the same prompt   
Reprompt: write another text prompt   
Edit: change brightness, contrast, etc   
Add 4s: add duration   
Upscale: enhance resolution   

**5 You can adjust settings before generating.**

The thumb image was published by NASA in 1972. The image shows the Apollo 17 landing site. The optic axis of the Mapping Camera is at a fixed angle relative to the spacecraft and is vertical when the spacecraft is in normal SIM Bay attitude. Mapping Camera stereo coverage is obtained by overlap, nominally 78 percent, of consecutive frames along the groundtrack. Oblique views area obtained by spacecraft attitude changes.
