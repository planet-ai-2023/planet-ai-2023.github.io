A vector is a quantity that involves both magnitude (size or length) and direction. Such quantities are represented geometrically by arrows, which are directed line segments, and are identified with these arrows.

Each point in the plane is determined by an ordered pair of numbers, and can be identified as a geometric point <code>(a,b)</code> with the column vector <code>sympy.Matrix([a,b])</code>. The geometric visualization of a vector is by including an arrow (directed line segment) form the origin (0,0) to the point.
