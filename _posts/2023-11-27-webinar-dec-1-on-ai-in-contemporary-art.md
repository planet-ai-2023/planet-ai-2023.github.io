This talk will trace the recent history of artists working with AI, from DeepDream and style transfer to GANs and DALL·E. It will present a variety of artistic approaches including developing new aesthetics, working with own drawings as datasets and coming up with unusual concepts.

She founded the NeurIPS Creativity and Design Workshop and curated the online galleries aiartonline.com and computervisionart.com. She is an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, she worked in start-ups, including the art collector database Larry’s List. She obtained her undergraduate degree in Modern Languages at the University of Cambridge.
