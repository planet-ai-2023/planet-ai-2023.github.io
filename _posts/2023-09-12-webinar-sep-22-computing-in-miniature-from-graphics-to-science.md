Step into a magnificent miniature wonderland where small insects gracefully traverse the surface of the pond, raindrops delicately splash upon vibrating foliage, and dragonflies glide and soar through the air. In these scenarios, a symphony of small-scale interactions unfolds, captivating the imagination. In this talk, Dr. Zhu will showcase his group's recent progress in developing advanced computational tools tailored to investigate the intricacies of these fascinating systems. His group's work encompasses three key aspects. First, they invent novel geometric representations and solvers to simulate the complex processes of small-scale solids and fluids. Second, they construct computational design and optimization algorithms to push the performance limits of these systems and synthesize designs inspired by nature's ingenuity. Lastly, they develop machine learning algorithms that integrate physical principles to uncover the governing mechanics underlying these intricate systems. These advancements constitute a fully automated computational pipeline, enabling the exploration of complex systems at a small length scale. Dr. Zhu will showcase applications of these computational tools in different disciplines, including pathogen transmission understanding, miniature robot design, new material discovery, and turbulence dynamics prediction.   

Dr. Bo Zhu is an Assistant Professor affiliated to the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research focuses on the intersection of computer graphics, computational physics, computational design and fabrication, and scientific machine learning. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University and completed postdoctoral training at MIT CSAIL. His works have been supported by multiple funding agencies and industrial sponsors. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award in 2022.

This event is supported by the National Science Foundation and also by the TN Space Grant Consortium at UTK.

The thumb image is published in 1972 by NASA. Here is the Apollo 17 landing site. The optic axis of the Mapping Camera is at a fixed angle relative to the spacecraft and is vertical when the spacecraft is in normal SIM Bay attitude. Mapping Camera stereo coverage is obtained by overlap,nominally 78 percent,of consecutive frames along the groundtrack. Oblique views area obtained by spacecraft attitude changes.
