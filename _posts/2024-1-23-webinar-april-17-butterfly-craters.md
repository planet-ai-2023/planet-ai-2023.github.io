Our invited speaker, Dr. Robert Herrick, is a Research Professor at the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks. Dr. Herrick got his PhD in Geophysics from the Southern Methodist University in 1993. He has been studying impact cratering throughout the solar system and also the relationship of interior processes to surface geology. Most of his work in the relationship of interior processes to surface geology has focused on the planet Venus. He combines imagery, topography, and geoid data to try and understand the big picture of how interior processes shape the surface now and over time.

This event is supported by the National Science Foundation and also by the TN Space Grant Consortium at UTK.
