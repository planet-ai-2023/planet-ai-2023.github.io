Emily Law will talk about the Solar System Treks. The Solar System Treks are online, browser-based portals that allow you to visualize, explore, and analyze the surfaces of other worlds using real data returned from a growing fleet of spacecrafts. You can view the worlds through the eyes of many different instruments, pilot real-time 3D flyovers above mountains and into craters, and conduct measurements of surface features. The portals provide exciting capabilities for mission planning, planetary science, and public outreach. Here's the Solar System Treks' webpage: [https://trek.nasa.gov/#](https://trek.nasa.gov/#){:target="_blank"}

Emily Law has been working at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over 20 years where she has provided leadership and management in data intensive system architecture, development and operations.  Emily currently serves as Deputy Program Manager overseeing Earth Science Data Systems technology development, in addition to managing the Solar System Treks Project.

This event is supported by the National Science Foundation and also by the TN Space Grant Consortium at UTK.
