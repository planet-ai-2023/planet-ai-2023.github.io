**Details:**    
On Friday, Oct 6, 4-5pm Eastern, Dr. Weizi Li will give us a talk on Mixed Traffic Control Via Reinforcement Learning. Modeling and managing mixed traffic, which encompasses both robot and human-driven vehicles, is an increasingly significant focus within the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems. In this talk, I will introduce our recent progress on controlling mixed traffic at complex and unsignalized intersections through multi-agent reinforcement learning. Furthermore, I will discuss our subsequent research endeavors and future directions projecting from transportation autonomy to urban design and planning. Dr. Weizi Li is an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UTK. He was a Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT and he received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the UNC Chapel Hill. His research interests include intelligent transportation systems, robotics, machine learning, and multi-agent simulation. He is passionate about using simulation and machine learning to design and develop next-gen cyber-physical infrastructure for urban environments. 
This event is supported by the National Science Foundation and also by the TN Space Grant Consortium at UTK.
