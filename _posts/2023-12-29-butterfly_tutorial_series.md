Use the butterfly dataset, you can explore the following Colab notebooks for computer vision tasks:   
1. [Classifying butterfly types in images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HfjGaiEI0TrF9AA0BbL57Bi8QUfucSmx/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}: highlighting the need for data augmentation and complex model structures as tasks become more intricate.
2. [Vision-Transformer for butterfly classification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pz9JI-RmBeBoHFpDt7k48zFknb5Dhk14/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}: introducing the Transformer model family.
