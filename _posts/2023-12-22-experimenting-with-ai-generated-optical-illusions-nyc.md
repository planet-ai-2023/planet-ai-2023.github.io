**Discussions**   
We examined the GitHub page and talked about the arxiv article and then we created optical illusions with the colab notebooks provided by the article authors. We tried flips, rotations, jigsaw rearrangements. We discussed the following questions:
- What is the difference between Midjourney and the code we navigated today?
- How can we perform color inversion with the given Colab notebook?
- What is the difference between a flip of an image and a 180 degree rotation? 
- How would AI generated images, in this case, optical illusions affect our lives? In other words, how can we use this technique in our everyday life?
