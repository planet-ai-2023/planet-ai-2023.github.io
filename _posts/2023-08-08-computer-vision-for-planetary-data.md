The thumbnail image of this article is an upscaled image of the photomicrograph of the Apollo lunar rock #65015 thin section. The rock was collected from the lower slope of Stone Mountain but the exact lunar orientation is unknown. It's said that Charlie Duke was holding the sample 65015 at Station 5 (Stone Mountain), Apollo 16. This sample is an impact melt breccia. Here's the some of the dialogue between Charlie Duke and John Young as they discuss the rock: 

> &nbsp;<em>Duke: John?</em>  
> &nbsp;<em>Young: Yes, sir.</em>   
> &nbsp;<em>Duke: That is the best sample we got.</em>   
> &nbsp;<em>Young: I know it.</em>   
> &nbsp;<em>Duke: I'll tell you. That is a crystalline rock if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.</em>   
> &nbsp;<em>Young: First one today!</em>   
> &nbsp;<em>Duke: Yeah.</em>   
> &nbsp;<em>Young: (Laughing) At least the first one you could say was one, maybe.</em>    
> &nbsp;<em>Duke: That is a great rock.</em>
