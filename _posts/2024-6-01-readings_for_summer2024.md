**Questions we seek to answer**:
- What is AI and what isn’t?
- What can AI do and cannot?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of AI/ML?
- Should we learn programming /coding since AI can code?
- Which jobs will never be replaced by AI?
- What is the next billion-dollar startup?
- How can I use AI/ML to help my families, my communities and promote social good?
- Did Stable Diffusion steal art?
- Why do LLMs hallucinate?
