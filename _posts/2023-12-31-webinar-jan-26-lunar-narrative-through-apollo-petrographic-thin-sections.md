The speaker Hairuo Fu is a PhD student at Harvard University. Hairuo is a geo/cosmochemist and paleomagnetist intrigued by the understanding of terrestrial planetary genetics, differentiation, and evolution. He is currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. His research interests encompass tracing the formation and early evolution of the Earth-Moon system using elements and isotopes, understanding stable isotopic fractionation during high-temperature magmatic processes, developing radiogenic isotope systematics for applications in geochronology and mantle source heterogeneity, and reconstructing ancient plate tectonics using remanent magnetization recorded in terrestrial rocks.


This event is supported by the National Science Foundation and also by the TN Space Grant Consortium at UTK.
